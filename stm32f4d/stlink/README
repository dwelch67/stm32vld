This is derived from the stlink code here:

https://github.com/texane/stlink

stlink2_ram filename.bin

Loads the .bin file to 0x20000000 and starts it.  Stack pointer is set
for you if you dont want to do it yourself.

stlink2_flash filename.bin

Minimal implementation, loads 0x4000, one flash page, to 0x08000000, if
your binary is smaller it pads it if longer it clips it.
