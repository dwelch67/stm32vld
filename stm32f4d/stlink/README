This is derived from the stlink code here:

https://github.com/texane/stlink

stlink2_ram filename.bin

Loads the .bin file to 0x20000000 and starts it.  Stack pointer is set
for you if you dont want to do it yourself.

stlink2_flash filename.bin

Minimal implementation, loads 0x4000, one flash page, to 0x08000000, if
your binary is smaller it pads it if longer it clips it.

dummy.bin is a tiny infinite loop program that you can load into the
flash so that you know that when you run from ram whatever was in flash
does not mess with clocks or other things.  Your from ram experience is
more simlar to a run from rom experience.
