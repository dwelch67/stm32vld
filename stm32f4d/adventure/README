This is the classic game of adventure.  Yeah, really, on a
microcontroller.

It needs some debugging, perhaps compiler, perhaps code, who knows.

Brought this over from mbed_samples and changed uart/ram definitions
for this chip.  Seems to work much better, perhaps it because there
is a lot more room on this one, room for a stack, etc.

Tried gcc thumb and thumb and clang opt thumb and thumb2 and they all
appear to work.  or at least dont crash right away.

The command parser is crude if you backspace you basically hose the
command line, try again.
