See the README one level up about where to find the reference manual
for the stm32f4 and schematics for the board.

This is derived from blinker03.

The main internal clock is set to 168MHz.  PPRE1 is a divide by 8 to get
it to 21MHz.  This is divided down in the uart to be used to create
16x oversampled 9600 baud.

I very much like that this is not another 8250 clone, in fact all of
the defaults are idea, 8 bits no parity 1 stop bit no interrupts you dont
have to change any bits from the default.  You set the divisor register
and turn the uart on.  You can separate enable the TX and RX side of the
uart.  This example at the moment is simply interested in getting the
uart divisor right or close enough and getting the uart up and running
at all.

Not polling the transmit buffer empty because this example is using a
timer to dribble one character a second out the port, if the port cant
deliver one character in a second then something is seriously broken.
The next example will add to this one and use the transmit status bits.
