See the README one level up about where to find the reference manual
for the stm32f4 and schematics for the board.

Note the external 8MHz clock is used to get a stable 9600 baud on
the uart.

Looks like my version of stlink is allowing the rom to run at some
point.  If the rom is data that causes the microcontroller to crash
you may have to use the stlink2_flash program instead.  I had it where
I couldnt run from ram depending on what I programmed into the rom. (without
using a flash tool like stlink2_flash, to repair the flash).

Copy a flash binary you want to program to a file named flash-bin, then
make this project and run it from ram.

If flash-bin is zero length, for example

rm -f flash-bin
touch flash-bin

then it will run a rom test across the first 64Kbytes, four sectors.
fill once then read back.
