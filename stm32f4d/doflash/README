for the stm32f4 and schematics for the board.

Learning to programmatically erase and write to the flash.

it (still) appears, that you can write the whole sector before
waiting on the busy bit.  0xA8600 clocks if you wait on each write
and 0x88600 if you only wait at the end of the sector.

Note the external 8MHz clock is used to get a stable 9600 baud on
the uart.
