Just having some fun.  Curious to know how the hardware fpu compared
to TestFloat.  Extracted only the add function which is easy/boring
and it looks good.  A NaN is not a fixed bit pattern so not surprising
they dont match.  I guess I could have said if this is a nan and that
is a nan then pass, instead I said if TestFloat says nan, continue;

llvm likes to throw memcpy()'s into code with structures where gcc
doesnt.  Very ugly memcpy() implementation, which probably hurts llvm's
overall slowfloat performance.
