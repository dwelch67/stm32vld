See the README one level up about where to find the reference manual
for the stm32f4 and schematics for the board.

derived from midi01, see midi01

Bought one of these:

Only focusing on watching the midi data, hooked it up to my Roland
drum set with a TD-9 computer.

Added time stamps, microcontroller to host computer is now at 155200
baud.  For every byte that comes in on midi, that byte plus two bytes
of timestamp are sent to the host.

The timer is based on a 84MHz clock and the timestamp divided by 4096,
so in theory 20507.8125 ticks per second for the 16 bit timer used.
One fourth of a second is about 5147 ticks.  I am seeing the 0xFE byte
come in closer to 5148 ticks.  Could be just a subtle difference in
clocks perhaps.
